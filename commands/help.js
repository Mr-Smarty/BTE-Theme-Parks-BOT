                Each application can have 3 statuses: TRUE, FALSE, or undefined. Unreviewed applications have an undefined status. Reviewed applications either have a TRUE status for accepted or a FALSE status for denied. \n
                Note that each application command that gets application data or updates it will take a few seconds. Trying to run an application multiple times before a result is given could cause problems. \n
                Each application also has an ID. An application's ID is equal to its row number in the google sheet - 1 to account for the header row. You can get information for a specific application by using its ID. \n
                Accepting an application will give the applicant the builder role, granting them building permissions and send a DM. Denying an application will only set the status to FALSE, and send the user a DM with the denial reason. You can only accept and deny applications that are unreviewed. \n
                Use \`=commands app\` to see all the commands and their usage for reviewing, accepting, denying, listing, and viewing application.`)
